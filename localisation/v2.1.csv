EVTNAME2604;Stanley Baldwin Resigns;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC2604;Having successfully negotiated the abdication crisis the elderly Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin felt it was time to retire. Three times Prime Minister during the age of mass Democracy in Great Britain he was commanding figure of the politics of the 20’s and 30’s.

EVTNAME2605;The Norway Debate;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC2605;Question put, 'That this House do now adjourn' The Ayes to the left 281, the Noes to the right 200.\nChamberlain had a commanding majority in the commons, but 41 Conservative MPs voted to bring down their own government and a further 60 refused to support it, it was clear that Chamberlain’s support was crumbling. The sight of Admiral of the Fleet Sir R. Keyes, voting against his own government while in full uniform shock the moral of the Conservative back benchers. Only a new Prime Minister could command support in the House of Commons. It was down to either Churchill or Halifax to lead the country, but Halifax was a peer and this could cause problems in leading a government. Chamberlain called together Halifax, Churchill and the government chief whip David Margesson. Chamberlain asked whom the King should call as the next Prime Minster?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA2605;Halifax Speaks First;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB2605;Churchill Speaks First;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME2606;The King Calls Churchill;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC2606;'I do not believe it is possible to effectively lead this government from the House of Lords', was Halifax’s reply.\nHalifax hit the numb of the problem, with war such an expensive business and the Commons now holding a monopoly on taxation and spending it would very difficult for a Prime Minister to govern from the Lords in the way that Lord Salisbury did. Chamberlain resigned himself to his favoured candidate not getting the post and went to the King and recommended Churchill.\n Churchill stood up in the House of Commons and told them, 'You ask, what is our policy? I will say: It is to wage war';;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA2606;Winston is Back;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME2607;The King Calls Halifax;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC2607;'I do not believe it is possible to effectively lead this government from the House of Lords', was Churchill’s reply.\nHowever, Churchill over played his hand, at this moment in time when the country needed unity being seen to be too ambitious was not acceptable. Margesson left the meeting and the whispering campaign amongst the backbenchers began. Churchill simply could not be trusted. Chamberlain went to the King and recommended Halifax,\n Halifax stood up in the House of Lords and told them, 'My noble lords you ask, what is our policy? I will say this: To defend British interests';;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA2607;Halifax is the Man;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
