######################
Tech AI
- Tuned the AI to get a more accurate count of how many research slots it has based on the slider shifts withought having to wait for the next tick.

RC9
- Tech AI has a new weight system for research techs (Major powers get a specific one for each) to may rules to put in notes.
- Slider AI had the values Diplomacy and NCO fliped which was causing them to set them incorectly.
- Redid the Slider distribution code to be a little more simpler. AI will concentrate way more on research now.

Production

RC9
- USA will build more ships in the early years (even if it fails MP checks) as long as it has more than 100 MP
- Changed order prio on what units to build first over others.
- Fixed an issue where transport ships where not being built in serial runs
- If there is IC left over after doing AI build requests the AI will build a few extra units based on what was not asked for!
- AI will build buildings now if IC is available but it was not able to meet manpower checks (gives it somethign to do with it).
- Building functionality was moved into a seperate method to make it easier to call.
- More performance IC checks added into the begining of the method.
- AI is now limited to building 2 of each building type at the same time.
- AI will now build a max of 5 AA in a province.
- AI will now build no more than 2 coastal forts in a single province (same with Radar Stations)
- China, France and Russia will no longer build coastal forts
- Fixed a bug where the cost of the minor attachments was not being calculated corectly when the AI was trying to figure out how much it was using.
- Added a manpower check for major powers building buildings. If the AI is low on manpower the limits placed on how many buildings he builds will be removed.
- Any country that has over 50 IC will create full divisions, if they are less than 50 then single brigades will be built
